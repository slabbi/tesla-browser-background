# Tesla Webbrowser Gallery

The Tesla Entertainment System does not offer the option of setting your own background or displaying an image.

If you have your own web space, you can display a small image gallery via the web browser using this script.

In the ``index.html`` file, the ``max`` parameter determines how many images are available. The images are stored in the same directory under the name ``picX.jpg`` (x=1...max).

The image is scaled so that it completely fills the web browser. At the top there are buttons with which an image can be selected directly. The "Change" button switches to the next image and at the same time sets a timer to 5 minutes. After the timer has expired, the image is switched to the next image.
